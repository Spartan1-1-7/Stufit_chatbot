This book covers haematology, immunology, and biochemistry. Blood tests provide crucial information for medical decisions. Each section has dedicated examples. Knowledge needs practice, so case studies are included. Labs may differ in where tests are performed. Units like g/L or mmol/L are common. Reference ranges are important but vary by hospital and population. Near patient testing offers rapid results. This is Part 1: Haematology and Blood Transfusion. Objectives and Scope are listed in Table 1. The lab provides info on blood cells and clotting. Blood Transfusion gives components like red cells. All samples must be labeled correctly. Basic blood tubes are used: EDTA for FBC, sodium citrate for coagulation. ESR may need its own tube. Immunologists use serum or plasma. Failure to use the correct tube will result in a repeat request. Haematology has red cell, white cell, and coagulation areas. Anaemia, infection, neoplasia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage are major problems. Chapter 1: The Red Blood Cell. Key words: Haemoglobin (Hb), Red blood cell count (RBCC), Haematocrit (Hct), Mean cell volume (MCV), Mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), Mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), Red cell distribution width (RDW), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Key pathological expressions: Anaemia, Polycythaemia, Thalassaemia, Sickle cell disease. Haemoglobin is a protein designed to carry oxygen. Reference range varies. Red blood cells lack a nucleus. Hct expresses proportion of whole blood by cells. MCV is the size of average red blood cell. MCH is average amount of Hb in cell. MCHC merges MCV and MCH. These are red cell indices. RDW quantifies variation in cell size. ESR is a global score of physical aspects of blood. Increased ESR has many causes. Other haematology tests include plasma viscosity, iron, ferritin, and B12. Reticulocytes are immature red cells. What are red cells for? To carry oxygen. Insufficient oxygen (hypoxia) causes symptoms like tiredness. Hypoxia can be due to lung disease or heart failure. Anaemia means reduced oxygen carrying capacity. It can be defined by low Hb and symptoms. More serious signs include jaundice. Anaemia classification: depressed red cell production (cancer, aplastic anaemia, drugs), diet deficiency (iron, B12, folate), loss of mature red cells (drugs, fevers, auto-immunity, bleeding), haemoglobinopathy (sickle cell, thalassaemia), disease in other organs (liver). Case report: microcytic anaemia.\n",

    "        'Wallach.pdf': \"\"\"Wallach’s Interpretation of Diagnostic Tests. This book provides a comprehensive guide to diagnostic tests. It covers a wide array of laboratory medicine disciplines, including clinical chemistry, hematology, immunology, and microbiology. The text details the principles behind various tests, their clinical applications, and interpretation of results in the context of different diseases. It emphasizes the importance of understanding normal ranges and how deviations indicate pathology. Key sections include discussions on organ system diseases, such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular disorders, and how laboratory markers aid in their diagnosis and management. The book also covers infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, and cancer markers. It highlights the role of laboratory data in patient care, from initial diagnosis to monitoring treatment efficacy. Special considerations for different patient populations, including pediatrics and geriatrics, are also addressed. The significance of various blood tests, such as those for electrolytes, glucose, lipids, and blood cell counts, is explained in detail. Interpretation of complex lab panels and the impact of medications on test results are also central themes. It is a vital resource for understanding the diagnostic utility of laboratory tests in clinical practice.\n",

This book is a practical guide to interpreting blood test results. It aims to demystify complex topics for healthcare professionals, students, and patients. The book introduces a 10-point system and uses storytelling to explain abstract concepts, like 'fire engines' for neutrophils. It emphasizes considering four key questions when interpreting results: how far out of range is it, does it make sense, do family groups support the result, and is it an important test? It details the difference between biochemistry (chemicals) and haematology (cells). The book covers blood collection methods, haemolysed samples, and reference ranges, noting that ranges are specific to machines and local settings. It discusses clinical sensitivity and specificity, distinguishing true/false positives/negatives. Clinical decision limits (CDLs) are introduced for managing patient care based on specific result thresholds. Chapters delve into the full blood count (FBC), coagulation, inflammatory markers, the immune system, chronic disease markers (diabetes, cholesterol), thyroid function, bone profile, and renal function (urea and electrolytes). It explains the clinical implications of various markers like CRP, ESR, PV, ALT, AST, bilirubin, GGT, albumin, and coagulation factors (INR, D-dimer). The book highlights the interconnectedness of organ systems (e.g., kidney and red cell production, liver and inflammation). It also addresses complex scenarios like anaemia of chronic disease and neuropathies. Transfusion testing, ABO/Rh blood groups, and transfusion reactions are covered. The afterword emphasizes the importance of systematic planning in interpreting blood tests.\n",
